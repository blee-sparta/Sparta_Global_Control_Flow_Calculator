# Sparta_Global_Control_Flow_Calculator
Week 3 Day 1 Homework - Control Flow Calculator

Use control flow to create a calculator

Using everything you've learned to this point create a simple calculator.

Timings

This lab should take approximately 90 minutes.

Hints and tips

The following might help:

if
else
prompt
console.log
prompt returns a string even if you type in a number. You might need to change it to a number
Feature 1

User should be able to enter two values to add together. The sum of the two values should be shown to the user. This should work for all numbers including decimals.

Feature 2

User should be able to enter two values then choose between adding, diving, subtracting, or multiplying. The answer should be shown to the user.

Feature 3

Calculator should choose addition if the user leaves it blank.

Bonus

Research the while loop.

User should be able to make more than one calculation or choose to quit the calculator


Challenges:

-> Working out an effective way of using the loop to make the process repeatable with a working exit method.
-> Incorporating a change of variable type in order to allow the addition calculations to be carried out without just adding strings together.

In the future:

-> I would like to be able to use functions in order to make the code cleaner and more effective.
-> I would prefer to get the input and output on the webpage rather than in the prompt and add some decoration and styling to the product.
